            <h3>Tour to Sognsvann</h3>
                <p>You didn't actually see Tuco? You got this money from Tuco? Tuco gave you this is what you're saying? You made a deal? How... why would you make a deal with that scumbag? You see what he did to me? No way man, okay, no understanding! Without even talking to me, you told this... insane ass-clown, dead-eyed killer, that uh... that we would give him two pounds a week? 

Don't talk to me about hours, what about sudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is gonna just bring it to us? God it takes me a week to get this stuff. I'm driving all the way up to Las Cruces, two hundred miles each way to meet up with my Smurfs. The dudes who go to the drug stores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell 'em to me. And that's maybe only good for, like a half pound worth. See that's the bottle neck in your brilliant business plan. Of course you would've known that if you would've just asked me. </p>

                <p>You talk about rehab oh gee, isn't that wonderful? Okay, you know what you need? I'll tell you exactly what you need. I am calling the police. I have tried ten years of love and understanding, maybe what it takes is you drying out in a jail cell.

            <h3>Tour to Akureyri in Iceland</h3>
                <p>I mean we're definitely not talking, you know, bathtub crank here, this is a big ass operation. You know, hundred of pounds a week, maybe more. Other than the fact that he's deader than a Texas salad bar and has a decent set of pipes, I'd say he's my guy. There's this mystery man I've been chasing for the better part of a year. Cooks the purest meth that uh me or anyone else has ever seen. Goes by the name of Heisenberg. Yeah, pretty weird, huh? 

I looked him up it was one of these physicists, one of Hitler's guys, physicist named Werner Heisenberg - real cute huh? Anyway, I figure with a handle like that my guy's gotta be some sort of a, some sort of an of egg head. No offense. And here we go, Gale 'Major Tom' Boetticher. Anyway, I just wanna see if I'm you know, not barking up the wrong tree chemically speaking. Uh, as far as I can make out, he's writing about a phenylacetone cook, right? That's pretty rare these days, but it does jive with the blue stuff I've been tracking. </p>
