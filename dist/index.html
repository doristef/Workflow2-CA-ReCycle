            <h3>3.000.000- Customers!</h3>
                <p>Look, let's crunch some numbers. How much money are we laundering? Yeah, apparently. All right, $16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes out to $9,960. Congratulations, you've just left your family a second hand Subaru. 

Two words: nail, salon. It's perfect for money laundering, it's a high-volume, cash-preferred business with a discreet workforce. Nobody does mista-me-know-nothing better than Mrs. Mukjayaporn and her gals. 

Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do. But uh, in this business... and Walt can back me up on this... the uh, number one rule is, don't take things personally. 

Drum roll, please. Wait for it. Lazer tag. Lazer tag! 7,000 square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernalillo County! It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist, scientists love lazers. Plus, they got bumper boats, so... </p>

                <p>I need support. Me! The almost 40-year old pregnant woman with the surprise baby on the way and the husband with lung cancer who disappears for hours on end. And I don't know where he goes and he barely even speaks to me anymore. With the moody son who does the same thing, and the overdrawn checking account, and the lukewarm water heater that leaks rusty looking crap and, and is rotting out the floor of the utility closet, and we can't even afford to fix it but Oh, I see, now I am supposed to go 'Hank, please what can I possibly do to further benefit my spoiled, kleptomaniac, bitch sister who somehow always manages to be the center of attention, cuz God knows, she is the one with the really important problems. 

Somehow, something tells me Hank is here because of you. And I'm not forgetting that. Walt, please, let's both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing and admit you're in danger! Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family. </p>
